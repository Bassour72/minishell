âœ… Steps to Catch Child Exit:
Call fork()

Creates a child process.

In the child (pid == 0)

Do the work, then call exit(status).

In the parent

Use waitpid(child_pid, &status, 0) to wait for the child to finish.

Analyze status using macros:

WIFEXITED(status) â€” true if child exited normally.

WEXITSTATUS(status) â€” gives the exit code.

WIFSIGNALED(status) â€” true if child was terminated by a signal.

WTERMSIG(status) â€” gives the terminating signal number.

ðŸ§  Example Behavior
Macro	Purpose
WIFEXITED(s)	Child exited via exit() or return
WEXITSTATUS(s)	Gets exit code (if WIFEXITED is true)
WIFSIGNALED(s)	Child was killed by signal
WTERMSIG(s)	Which signal caused termination 

1. Limit your max number of processes (to prevent freezing your system): 

ulimit -u 50
